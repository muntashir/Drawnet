# Drawnet

http://drawnet.herokuapp.com/

Only supports numbers for now because of Heroku memory limits. If the buttons are disabled, the net is busy. They should enable again once it's done processing.  

To train it, draw a number and press the train button to teach it what the number is. The next time it guesses your drawing, it should be correct.
